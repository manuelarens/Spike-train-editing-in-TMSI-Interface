        1. Sets up instance variables using the provided parameters, including the EMG data file,
        whether to add a reference signal, time unit preference, figure size, and layout settings.
        2. Validates and processes the EMG data from the provided file, specifically the IPTS and MUPULSES data.
        3. Initializes the x-axis based on whether the time is measured in seconds or samples.
        4. Sets the initial motor unit index to 0.
        5. Prepares lists and arrays for tracking plot states, including flags for the first plot,
        recalculated SIL values, and arrays for storing SIL values and colors.
        6. Creates a matplotlib figure and axis for plotting, with specified figure size.
        7. Sets up RectangleSelector objects for adding and removing spikes on the plot.
        8. Initializes boolean flags for managing spike addition and removal.
        9. Plots the initial motor unit data.
        10. Connects event handlers for zooming, scrolling, and key press events.
        11. Adds navigation buttons for moving between motor units.
        12. Optionally plots a reference signal if specified.
        13. Configures the plot layout and displays the plot if required.

        Parameters:
        - emgfile (dict): A dictionary containing EMG data including 'IPTS', 'MUPULSES', and 'FSAMP'.
        - addrefsig (bool): Flag to indicate whether to add a reference signal to the plot.
